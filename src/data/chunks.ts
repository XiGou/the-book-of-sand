  "The Book of Sand\nThy rope of sands . . . - George Herbert",
  "The line is made up of an infinite number of points; the plane of an infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of volumes . . . No, unquestionably this is not - more geometrico - the best way of beginning my story. To claim that it is true is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine, however, is true.",
  "I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on Belgrano Street, in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features - or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way. Dressed in grey and carrying a grey suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from the Orkneys.",
  "I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him - as it does now from me.",
  "'I sell Bibles,' he said.",
  "Somewhat pedantically, I replied, 'In this house are several English Bibles, including the first - John Wiclif's. I also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's - which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst - and a Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need of.'",
  "After a few moments of silence, he said, 'I don't only sell Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you.'",
  "He opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words 'Holy Writ' and, below them, 'Bombay'.",
  "'Nineteenth-century, probably,' I remarked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I've never found out.'",
  "I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in double columns, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries - an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.",
  "It was at this point that the stranger said, 'Look at the illustration closely. You'll never see it again.'",
  "I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the anchor. 'It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?' I said to hide my dismay.",
  "'No,' he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. 'I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the Book of Sand, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.'",
  "The stranger asked me to find the first page. I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.",
  "'Now find the last page.' Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely managed to stammer, 'This can't be.'",
  "Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, 'It can't be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last. I don't know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.'",
  "Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, 'If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time.'",
  "His speculations irritated me. 'You are religious, no doubt?' I asked him. 'Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book.'",
  "I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume. 'You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns,' he corrected.",
  "While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked, 'Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the British Museum?' 'No. I'm offering it to you,' he said, and he stipulated a rather high sum for the book.",
  "I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme. 'I propose a swap,' I said. 'You got this book for a handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the amount of my pension cheque, which I've just collected, and my black-letter Wiclif Bible. I inherited it from my ancestors.' 'A black-letter Wiclif!' he murmured.",
  "I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the leaves and studied the title page with all the fervour of a true bibliophile. 'It's a deal,' he said. It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell the book. Without counting the money, he put it away.",
  "We talked about India, about Orkney, and about the Norwegian jarls who once ruled it. It was night when the man left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name.",
  "I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and One Nights. I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the ninth power.",
  "I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A prisoner of the book, I almost never went out anymore.",
  "After studying its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was not long in filling up. Never once was an illustration repeated. At night, in the meagre intervals my insomnia granted, I dreamed of the book.",
  "Summer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous. What good did it do me to think that I, who looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my hands, was any less monstrous? I felt that the book was a nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and tainted reality itself.",
  "I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite book might likewise prove infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke. Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest. Before retirement, I worked on Mexico Street, at the Argentine National Library, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew that to the right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept. One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the door, I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement's musty shelves.",

  "沙之书\n……你的沙制的绳索……\n乔治·赫伯特",
  "线是由一系列的点组成的；无数的线组成了面；无数的面形成体积；庞大的体积则包括无数体积……不，这些几何学概念绝对不是开始我的故事的最好方式。如今人们讲虚构的故事时总是声明它千真万确，不过我的故事一点不假。",
  "我单身住在贝尔格拉诺街一幢房子的五楼。几个月前的一天傍晚，我听到门上有剥啄声。我开了门，进来的是个陌生人。他身材很高，面目模糊不清。也许是我近视，看得不清楚。他的外表整洁，但透出一股寒酸。他一身灰色的衣服，手里提着一个灰色的小箱子。乍一见面，我就觉得他是外国人。开头我认为他上了年纪，后来发现并非如此，只是他那斯堪的纳维亚人似的稀疏的、几乎泛白的金黄色头发给了我错误的印象。我们谈话的时间不到一小时，从谈话中我知道他是奥克尼群岛人。",
  "我请他坐下。那人过了一会儿才开口说话。他散发着悲哀的气息，就像我现在一样。",
  "「我卖《圣经》，」他对我说。",
  "我不无卖弄地回说：「这间屋子里有好几部英文的《圣经》，包括最早的约翰·威克里夫版。我还有西普里亚诺·德巴莱拉的西班牙文版，路德的德文版，从文学角度来说，是最差的，还有武加大拉丁文版。你瞧，我这里不缺《圣经》。」",
  "他沉默了片刻，然后搭腔说：「我不光卖《圣经》。我可以给你看看另一部圣书，你或许会感兴趣。我是在比卡内尔一带弄到的。」",
  "他打开手提箱，把书放在桌上。那是一本八开大小、布面精装的书。显然已有多人翻阅过。我拿起来看看，异乎寻常的重量使我吃惊。书脊上面印的是「圣书」，下面是「孟买」。",
  "「看来是十九世纪的书，」我说。「不知道。我始终不清楚，」他回答说。",
  "我信手翻开。里面的文字是我不认识的。书页磨损得很旧，印刷粗糙，像《圣经》一样，每页两栏。版面分段，排得很挤。每页上角有阿拉伯数字。页码的排列引起了我注意，比如说，逢双的一页印的是40.514，接下去却是999。我翻过那一页，背面的页码有八位数。像字典一样，还有插画：一个钢笔绘制的铁锚，笔法笨拙，仿佛小孩画的。",
  "那时候，陌生人对我说：「仔细瞧瞧。以后再也看不到了。」声调很平和，但话说得很绝。",
  "我记住地方，合上书。随即又打开。尽管一页页地翻阅，铁锚图案却再也找不到了。我为了掩饰惶惑，问道：「是不是《圣经》的某种印度斯坦文字的版本？」「不是的，」他答道。",
  "然后，他像是向我透露一个秘密似的压低声音说：「我是在平原上一个村子里用几个卢比和一部《圣经》换来的。书的主人不识字。我想他把圣书当作护身符。他属于最下层的种姓，谁踩着他的影子都认为是晦气。他告诉我，他那本书叫『沙之书』，因为那本书像沙一样，无始无终。」",
  "他让我找找第一页。我把左手按在封面上，大拇指几乎贴着食指去揭书页。白费劲：封面和手之间总是有好几页，仿佛是从书里冒出来的。",
  "「现在再找找最后一页。」我照样失败。我目瞪口呆，说话的声音都变得不像是自己的：「这不可能。」",
  "那个《圣经》推销员还是低声说：「不可能，但事实如此。这本书的页码是无穷尽的。没有首页，也没有末页。我不明白为什么要用这种荒诞的编码办法。也许是想说明一个无穷大的系列允许任何数项的出现。」",
  "随后，他像是自言自语地说：「如果空间是无限的，我们就处在空间的任何一点。如果时间是无限的，我们就处在时间的任何一点。」",
  "他的想法使我心烦。我问他：「你准是教徒喽？」「不错，我是长老会派。我问心无愧。我确信我用《圣经》同那个印度人交换他的邪恶的书时绝对没有蒙骗。」",
  "我劝他说没有什么可以责备自己的地方，问他是不是路过这里。他说打算待几天就回国。那时我才知道他是苏格兰奥克尼群岛的人。我说出于对斯蒂文森和休谟的喜爱，我对苏格兰有特殊好感。「还有罗比·彭斯，」他补充道。",
  "我和他谈话时，继续翻弄那本无限的书。我假装兴趣不大，问他说：「你打算把这本怪书卖给不列颠博物馆吗？」「不。我卖给你，」他说着，开了一个高价。",
  "我老实告诉他，我付不起这笔钱。想了几分钟之后，我有了办法。「我提议交换，」我对他说。「你用几个卢比和一部《圣经》换来这本书，我现在把我刚领到的退休金和花体字的威克里夫版《圣经》和你交换。这部《圣经》是我家祖传。」「花体字的威克里夫版！」他咕哝说。",
  "我从卧室里取来钱和书。我像藏书家似的恋恋不舍地翻翻书页，欣赏封面。「好吧，就这么定了，」他对我说。使我惊奇的是他不讨价还价。后来我才明白，他进我家门的时候就决心把书卖掉。他接过钱，数也不数就收了起来。",
  "我们谈印度、奥克尼群岛和统治过那里的挪威首领。那人离去时已是夜晚。以后我再也没有见到他，也不知道他叫什么名字。",
  "我本想把那本沙之书放在威克里夫版《圣经》留下的空当里，但最终还是把它藏在一套不全的《一千零一夜》后面。我上了床，但是没有入睡。凌晨三四点，我开了灯，找出那本怪书翻看。其中一页印有一个面具。角上有个数字，现在记不清是多少，反正大到九次幂。",
  "我从不向任何人出示这件宝贝。随着占有它的幸福感而来的是怕它被偷掉，然后又担心它并不真正无限。我本来生性孤僻，这两层忧虑更使我反常。我有少数几个朋友，现在不往来了。我成了那本书的俘虏，几乎不再上街。我用一面放大镜检查磨损的书脊和封面，排除了伪造的可能性。我发现每隔两千页有一帧小插画。我用一本有字母索引的记事簿把它们临摹下来。簿子不久就用完了。插画没有一张重复。晚上，我多半失眠，偶尔入睡就梦见那本书。",
  "夏季已近尾声，我领悟到那本书是个可怕的怪物。我把自己也设想成一个怪物：睁着铜铃大眼盯着它，伸出带爪的十指拨弄它，但是无济于事。我觉得它是一切烦恼的根源，是一件诋毁和败坏现实的下流东西。",
  "我想把它付之一炬，但怕一本无限的书烧起来也无休无止，使整个地球乌烟瘴气。我想起有人写过这么一句话：隐藏一片树叶的最好的地点是树林。我退休之前在藏书有九十万册的国家图书馆任职，我知道门厅右边有一道弧形的梯级通向地下室，地下室里存放报纸和地图。我趁工作人员不注意的时候，把那本沙之书偷偷地放在一个阴暗的搁架上。我竭力不去记住搁架的哪一层，离门口有多远。",
  "我觉得心里稍稍踏实一点，以后我连图书馆所在的墨西哥街都不想去了。",
